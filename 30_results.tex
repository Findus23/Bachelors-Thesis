\chapter{Results}

For the large set of simulations we can now extract the needed value. The output of the relaxation program (\texttt{spheres\_ini\_log}) gives us the precise values for impact angle and velocity and the exact masses of all bodies. As theses values slightly differ from the parameters explained in Section \ref{sec:parameters} due to the setup of the simulation, in the following steps only the precise values are considered. From the \texttt{aggregates.txt} explained in Section \ref{sec:postprocessing} the final masses and water fractions of the two largest fragments are extracted. From these the main output considered in this analysis, the water retention of the two fragments can be calculated. 

\section{Correlations}
\label{sec:cov}
One very easy, but sometimes flawed\footnote{\todo[inline]{explain issues with pearson}} way to look at the whole dataset at once is calculating the \textit{Pearson correlation coefficient} between the input parameters and the output water fraction (Figure \ref{fig:cov}). This shows the expected result that a higher collision angle (so a more hit-and-run like collision) has a higher water retention and a higher collision speed results in far less water left on the two largest remaining fragments. In addition higher masses seem to result in less water retention. The initial water fractions of the two bodies does seem to have very little influence on the result of the simulations.
